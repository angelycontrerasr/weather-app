## Meaning
This is part of my projects for the Odin Project

## What I learned
I learned to connect to APIs and extract info from them

## Design
I wanted to keep it simple and look like a console/terminal because I will skip to advanced CSS since I already know the Computer Science principles of the curriculum because I did the CS50
